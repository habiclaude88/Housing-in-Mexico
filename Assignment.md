# Housing-in-Mexico
Assignment: Housing in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

import wqet_grader
â€‹
wqet_grader.init("Project 1 Assessment")
In this assignment, you'll work with a dataset of homes for sale in Brazil. Your goal is to determine if there are regional differences in the real estate market. Also, you will look at southern Brazil to see if there is a relationship between home size and price, similar to what you saw with housing in some states in Mexico.

Note: There are are 19 graded tasks in this assignment, but you only need to complete 18. Once you've successfully completed 18 tasks, you'll be automatically enrolled in the next project, and this assignment will be closed. This means that you might not be allowed to complete the last task. So if you get an error saying that you've already complete the course, that's good news! Move to project 2.
Before you start: Import the libraries you'll use in this notebook: Matplotlib, pandas, and plotly. Be sure to import them under the aliases we've used in this project.

# Import Matplotlib, pandas, and plotly
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
1. Prepare Data
In this assignment, you'll work with real estate data from Brazil. In the data directory for this project there are two CSV that you need to import and clean.

1.1. Import
Task 1.5.1: Import the CSV file data/brasil-real-estate-1.csv into the DataFrame df1.

df1 = pd.read_csv('data/brasil-real-estate-1.csv')

Frequent Question: I can't pass this question, and I don't know what I've done wrong. ðŸ˜  What's happening?

Tip: In this assignment, you're working with data that's similar â€” but not identical â€” the data used in the lessons. That means that you might need to make adjust the code you used in the lessons to work here. Take a second look at df1 after you complete 1.5.6, and make sure you've correctly created the state names.

1.2. Explore
It's time to start exploring your data. In this section, you'll use your new data visualization skills to learn more about the regional differences in the Brazilian real estate market.

Complete the code below to create a scatter_mapbox showing the location of the properties in df.

fig = px.scatter_mapbox(
    df,
    lat='lat',
    lon='lon',
    center={"lat": -14.2, "lon": -51.9},  # Map will be centered on Brazil
    width=600,
    height=600,
    hover_data=["price_usd"],  # Display price when hovering mouse over house
